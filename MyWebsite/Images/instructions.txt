To move files back and forth from your computer to the 2300 server,
you'll need a "Secure FTP" program.  If you don't have one of these
or don't know what it is, you can find a free version on the Internet.
For Windows users, we recommend "WinSCP", available at http://winscp.net.  Go to http://winscp.net/eng/download.php, and select "installation package" under the latest version
of WinSCP (5.1.3 as of this writing). Follow the instructions to
download and install WinSCP.

Windows users should then run WinSCP. The host name is "info2300.cs.cornell.edu" and the user name and password is your user name and password for the 2300 server.  Click "Login".  Once you are connected, the left-hand panel displays the files on your computer, while the right-hand panel displays the files on your account on the 2300 server.  You can drag and drop files between the two.  You should have a folder on the 2300 server called "hw0".  Put your page index.html into this  folder.

We currently have no instructions for Mac users.
